# SpotifyToYoutube Backend - Database Integration Summary

## What We've Accomplished

### 🗄️ **Neo4j Database Integration**
- **Added Neo4j support** with the `neo4rs` crate
- **Created comprehensive data models** for Artists, Tracks, Albums, and Playlists
- **Implemented relationship mapping** between all entities
- **Set up proper indexing and constraints** for performance

### 📊 **Database Schema**
The system now stores music data in a graph database with these relationships:
- `(Artist)-[:PERFORMED]->(Track)` - Artist performed a track
- `(Album)-[:CONTAINS]->(Track)` - Album contains a track  
- `(Playlist)-[:INCLUDES]->(Track)` - Playlist includes a track (with position)
- `(Artist)-[:RELEASED]->(Album)` - Artist released an album

### 🔄 **Music Data Service**
- **Playlist storage**: Complete playlist data from Spotify gets stored with all relationships
- **Track management**: Individual tracks with all metadata and relationships
- **Search capabilities**: Find tracks by name, ISRC, or other criteria
- **Conversion tracking**: Tracks that need YouTube URL conversion

### 🌐 **REST API Endpoints**
Added comprehensive API endpoints for database operations:
- `POST /api/playlists/:id/store` - Store playlist in database
- `GET /api/tracks/for-conversion` - Get tracks needing conversion
- `PUT /api/tracks/:id/youtube-url` - Update track YouTube URL
- `GET /api/playlists/:id/tracks` - Get playlist tracks with YouTube URLs
- `GET /api/tracks/search?q=query` - Search tracks in database
- `GET /api/conversion/stats` - Get conversion statistics
- `POST /api/tracks/:id/convert` - Manually convert track

### 🚀 **Conversion Service**
- **Mock YouTube conversion** service ready for real implementation
- **Background processing** framework (currently disabled for Send trait compatibility)
- **Rate limiting** and error handling for API calls
- **Manual conversion** endpoints for testing

## 📁 **New Files Created**
- `src/database.rs` - Neo4j database manager and operations
- `src/music_service.rs` - High-level music data service
- `src/conversion_service.rs` - YouTube conversion service (mock)
- `DATABASE_README.md` - Complete database setup guide
- `.env.example` - Environment configuration template

## 🔧 **Setup Required**

### 1. Neo4j Database
```bash
docker run --name neo4j -p7474:7474 -p7687:7687 -d \
  -v $HOME/neo4j/data:/data \
  --env NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/password \
  neo4j:latest
```

### 2. Environment Variables
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual credentials
```

### 3. Build and Run
```bash
cargo build
cargo run
```

## 📈 **Data Flow**

1. **Spotify Ingestion**: 
   - Fetch playlist from Spotify API
   - Store playlist, tracks, artists, albums in Neo4j
   - Create all relationships between entities

2. **YouTube Conversion**: 
   - Find tracks without YouTube URLs
   - Search YouTube for matching videos (mock implementation)
   - Update track records with YouTube URLs

3. **Playlist Reconstruction**:
   - Query Neo4j for playlist tracks
   - Return tracks with YouTube URLs for conversion
   - Maintain original playlist order and metadata

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

### Immediate:
- **Real YouTube API integration** (replace mock)
- **Improve error handling** for production use
- **Add authentication** to API endpoints

### Future Enhancements:
- **Batch processing** for large playlists
- **Duplicate detection** using ISRC codes
- **Advanced search** with fuzzy matching
- **Playlist synchronization** with Spotify changes
- **Analytics dashboard** for conversion statistics

## 🔍 **Key Benefits**

1. **Efficient Lookups**: Graph database allows fast relationship queries
2. **Avoid Re-conversion**: Track YouTube URLs to prevent duplicate work
3. **Scalable Architecture**: Can handle thousands of playlists and tracks
4. **Rich Metadata**: Preserves all Spotify data for future features
5. **Flexible Queries**: Graph structure supports complex music discovery

## 🧪 **Testing the API**

Once the server is running, you can test with:

```bash
# Store a playlist
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/playlists/441K4rF3u0qfg9m4X1WSQJ/store

# Check conversion stats
curl http://localhost:3000/api/conversion/stats

# Search for tracks
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/tracks/search?q=love&limit=5"
```

The backend now provides a solid foundation for the SpotifyToYoutube conversion service with proper data persistence and relationship management!
